1. I am in an intro to urban analytics course in which one of the modules is about text data and how to use them to better understand & manage cities. I plan to use Twitter data and API for this class only. I also do not plan to share or post the data anywhere.

2. The course includes basic text preprocessing (e.g., stemming, removing stop words), counting frequent words, making word cloud, and simple sentiment analysis.

3. The course material uses only tweets. Other functionalities are not included in the scope of the course.

Do you plan to display Tweets or aggregate data about Twitter content outside Twitter? No.

Will your product, service, or analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity? No.
