## Module 4 in a nutshell

1. Get Google API key.
2. Download street network data (OSM) and clean it.
3. Generate points along the edges. These will be where GSV images will be downloaded.
4. Calculate the heading of the cameras for each point. 
5. Create a function that takes a point as input and download GSV images.
6. Apply computer vision to the images.
7. Merge the results back to the points from Step 2.
* We will cover Steps 1-5 this week and Steps 6-7 next week.

## Why Street View Images

* Measuring built environment is important for numerous reasons - public health, public safety, environmental sustainability, economic vitality, tourism, etc.
* Built environment literature commonly differentiate between the urban form and streetscape.
  * ***Urban form***: macroscale-built environment which characterizes street connectivity, density, and diversity of land use.
  * ***Streetscape***: pertains to physical layout and design of the built environment, such as **sidewalk width, enclosure, tree canopy, landscaping, and street furniture**.
* Street View Images allow us to examine the streetscapes without traveling.

## Google Street View Images 

* Images taken at roughly 10 meter intervals from cameras that are (often but not always) mounted on car roof.
* 360-degree image in all directions.
* Have coverage both in US and internationally and can go back in time.

## Google Street View Images

* Around 2010, planning studies started using Google Street View (GSV) images.
* To audit street environments using GSV images.
* In early studies, still human auditors were looking at GSV and did manual audits.
* Recent studies are increasingly using computer vision instead of manual audits.

## Google Street View Images

* Web version of GSV is free but **.red[their API is NOT FREE!]** (7.00 USD per 1000 images)
* Maximum Queries per Minute (QPM): 30,000. Requests up to 25,000 per day require an API key.
* Do not distribute images nor use it for commercial purposes.
* You should **.red[NEVER EXPOSE]** your API key. You can get charged for a lot of money.
* Get your key [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ujhwang/UrbanAnalytics2023/main/Lab/module_4/how_to_get_your_key.pptx)
