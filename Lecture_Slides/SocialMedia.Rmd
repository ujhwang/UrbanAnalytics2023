# What Qualifies as "Social Media"? 
- Social media is digital technology that allows the sharing of ideas, information, events, and experiences through text and visuals within virtual networks and communities.
--


- It typically features user-generated content that usually seeks to engage of a wider group of individuals via likes, shares, comments, and discussion.
--


- <font color="red">Social media can be divided into six categories:
.pull-right[
- Social networking
- Social bookmarking
- Social news
- Media sharing
- Microblogging
- Online forums
  ]</font>
  

---
## These were the most widely used social media providers as of January 2023 (DataReportal)

-Facebook (2.96 billion users)

-YouTube (2.51 billion users)

-WhatsApp (2 billion users)

-Instagram (2 billion users)

-WeChat (1.31 billion users)

-TikTok (1.05 billion users)

#Social Media Analytics begin with <font color="red">Text Mining</font> 

<em>Text mining is the process of examining large collections of unstructured textual resources in order to generate new information, typically using specialized computer software</em>

# Characteristics of "Texts"

- High dimensionality with tens of thousands of words 
- Noisy data
- Erroneous data or misleading data
- Unstructured text
- Written resources, chat room conversations, or normal speech
- Ambiguity
- Word ambiguity or sentence ambiguity

#Text Preprocessing

- Text Cleanup
Normalize texts converted from binary formats (programs, media, images, and most compressed files)
Deal with tables, figures, and formulas

- Tokenization
Process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens

---
#Attribute Generation

### Two Approaches

- Bag of Words Model, used in methods of document classification, where the <font color="red">frequency of occurrence of each word </font> is used as a feature

- Vector Space Model, used cosine similarity to calculate a number that describes the similarity among documents

---
#Attribute Selection

- Reduction of high dimensionality

- Select just a subset of the features to represent a document

- Remove stop words

Can be viewed as creating an improved document representation

---
#Levels of text representations

###Lexical
- Character (character n-grams and sequences)
- Words (stop-words, stemming, lemmatization)
- Phrases (word n-grams, proximity features)
- Part-of-speech tags
- Taxonomies / thesauri
###Syntactic
- Vector-space model
- Language models
- Full-parsing
- Cross-modality

---
#Data Mining

### Traditional Data Mining Techniques:
- Classification
- Clustering
- Associations
- Sequential Patterns
- Extract information from the processed text data via data modeling and data visualization (visual maps)
### Data Visualization
- Communicate information clearly and efficiently to users via the statistical graphics, plots, information graphics, tables, and charts selected
- makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable

---
#Interpretation

- What story is the data telling?

- What is actionable in the information + knowledge gained?

- Is this an accurate picture (validation)?

- Are their hidden biases that needs to be explored?

##Sentiment Analysis
- It is a category of text classification tasks where you are supplied with a phrase, or a list of phrases and your classifier is supposed to tell if the sentiment behind that is positive, negative or neutral
